            <h3>Hi, my name is Tatum Mathieu and this is my website for GBDA 228. I chose to do a blog. I am a 19 year old girl from Chatham, Ontario. I enjoy all things nature, being creative, going out with friends and living new experiences. I wanted to incorporate my hobbies and interests into a website to make this assignment fun for me! My color palette is neutrals, which I love, as well as blue and green, which are my favorite colors. With this website I want to achieve a style that fits with my personality and is also fun and professional. I chose to call my ‘blog’ Tatum's Garden Couture because two of my favorite things are plants and clothes/fashion along with other things I enjoy like the arts, specifically fine arts and music.</h3>
